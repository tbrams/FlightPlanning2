# FlightPlanning2
This is the next evolution of the Google Sheet based planning tool I created while studying for my PPL license. It is still based on the Flight Plan format used by Copenhagen Air Taxa and the focus here is VFR route planning using Google Maps as a front end to the spreadsheet. 

Everything is controlled from a Google Sheet with this code installed.

When opening the sheet there will be a new menu point called "Navigation" - select that and start the Map based planning tool...
